# Portable Python IDE

## Description

This application is a portable Python IDE designed to run directly from a USB drive on Windows. It lets you set up a self-contained Python development environment by creating a dedicated **PPython** folder on your USB drive. You can use either a regular or a portable version of Python. When you launch the IDE, you'll be prompted to select your Python installation folder (the one containing `python.exe`), and the IDE will use that environment to run your scripts.

### Key Features

- **Code Editor:**  
  - Syntax highlighting and line numbering.
  - Search and replace functionality.

- **Integrated Output & Debug Panels:**  
  - Real-time output display.
  - Debugger interface using pdb for step-by-step execution.

- **Package Management:**  
  - Install, upgrade, list, and import Python packages.
  - Export and import requirements files.

- **Auto-Save & Backup:**  
  - Automatically saves your work every few minutes.
  - Options for backing up configurations and scripts.

- **Standalone App Creation:**  
  - Convert your scripts into standalone executables using PyInstaller.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Prepare Your USB Drive:**
   - Create a folder named **PPython** on your USB drive. This folder will serve as the destination for your Python installation.

2. **Install Python:**
   - Install the regular version of Python using the official installer.
   - Optionally, copy the installed Python folder into your **PPython** folder on the USB drive if you want to keep everything portable.

3. **Copy the IDE Script:**
   - Place the IDE script (e.g., `RDB_To_CSV_Database_Viewer.py`) on your USB drive.

4. **Run the IDE:**
   - Launch the script on a Windows machine.
   - When prompted, select your Python installation folder (the one containing `python.exe`). This configures the IDE to use the chosen Python environment.

5. **Start Developing:**
   - Use the integrated code editor to write, run, and debug your Python scripts.
   - Manage packages and create standalone executablesâ€”all from your portable environment.
