## Description

This application is a portable Python IDE designed to run directly from a USB drive on Windows. It lets you set up a self-contained Python development environment by creating a dedicated `PPython` folder on your USB drive. You can use either a regular or a portable version of Python. When you launch the IDE, you'll be prompted to select your Python installation folder (the one containing `python.exe`), and the IDE will use that environment to run your scripts.

## Key Features

### Code Editor
- **Syntax Highlighting and Line Numbering:** Makes your code easier to read and debug.
- **Search and Replace:** Quickly locate and update code segments.

### Integrated Output & Debug Panels
- **Real-time Output Display:** See your program's output instantly.
- **Debugger Interface:** Utilize Pythonâ€™s built-in `pdb` for step-by-step execution.

### Package Management
- **Comprehensive Package Handling:** Install, upgrade, list, and import Python packages.
- **Requirements Files:** Easily export and import dependencies.

### Auto-Save & Backup
- **Auto-Save:** Automatically saves your work every few minutes.
- **Backup Options:** Back up your configurations and scripts to prevent data loss.

### Standalone App Creation
- **Executable Conversion:** Use PyInstaller to convert your scripts into standalone executables.

## Setup Instructions

### Prepare Your USB Drive
- **Create Folder:** Make a folder named `PPython` on your USB drive. This folder will serve as the destination for your Python installation.

### Install Python
- **Regular Installation:** Install the regular version of Python using the official installer.
- **Portable Option:** Optionally, copy the installed Python folder into your `PPython` folder if you want a fully portable setup.
- **Additional Packages:** Ensure `pip` and `pyqt5` are installed before the first launch, as they are required for the IDE's user interface.

### Copy the IDE Script
- **Script Placement:** Place the IDE script (e.g., `RDB_To_CSV_Database_Viewer.py`) on your USB drive.

### Run the IDE
- **Launch the Script:** Start the script on a Windows machine.
- **Select Python Folder:** When prompted, select your Python installation folder (the one containing `python.exe`). This configures the IDE to use the chosen Python environment.

### Start Developing
- **Write and Debug:** Use the integrated code editor to write, run, and debug your Python scripts.
- **Manage Packages and Build Executables:** All from your portable environment.
